# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# TODO: 語法建議
#  1. flutter pub deps
#     👉 查看套件實際運作的版本與依賴樹，用於確認 pubspec.yaml 宣告版本 vs 真實版本差異
#  2. flutter doctor -v
#     👉 檢查當前 Flutter 環境設定與 SDK 版本 (含 Dart/Android/iOS)，用於診斷環境問題與工具安裝狀況
#  3. flutter clean
#     👉 清理 build cache、暫存檔案與已下載的依賴，適用於編譯異常或套件版本衝突時
#  4. flutter pub get
#     👉 重新抓取並安裝 pubspec.yaml 裡定義的依賴套件，適用於新增/修改套件後
#  5. flutter pub outdated
#     👉 檢查目前套件版本、允許範圍內的最新版本、與 pub.dev 最新版
#  6. flutter run
#     👉 在連接的模擬器或實體裝置上執行專案
#  7. flutter build apk --release
#     👉 打包成 Android APK 釋出檔
#  8. flutter build ios --release
#     👉 打包成 iOS ipa（需搭配 Xcode）
#  9. flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
#     👉 執行 flutter_launcher_icons 套件指令產生 Android 各尺寸 APP Icon

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/app_icon.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
